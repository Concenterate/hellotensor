My personal ML(mainly CV) experiments with Keras.

Advice:

1. Python has limitations. JS is better. Julia is even better.
2. Keras is a must-have.
3. Use Google. If Google doesn't work very well, use English. If English is not your thing, please give up. You shouldn't be here.
4. Use TensorFlow(Keras' default backend) if you don't want to break things. Use Theano if you need Windows.
5. Keep reading papers. It's good for you!
